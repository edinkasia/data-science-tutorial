```

You will need to load the required libraries first: tidyverse and here.

```{r libraries}
# install.packages("here")
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

We will be using traumatic brain injury data from a Tidy Tuesday challenge
Learn more about the challenge and the data here (spend max 3 minutes looking at the linked page):
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/readme.md

Let's start by loading in the data

```{r loading-data}
tbi_age <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_age.csv')
tbi_year <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_year.csv')
```

Now, set up folders in your working directory: raw_data, scrips, plots and tables. Put this RMarkdown document in your scripts folder. 

### Task 1
Save both datasets in the raw_data folder (use the 'here' library)

```{r saving-data-locally}
write_csv(tbi_age, file= here("raw_data", "tbi_age.csv"))
write_csv(tbi_year, file= here("raw_data", "tbi_year.csv"))
```


### Task 2
Use your favourite functions for eyeballing data and write a couple of sentences about each dataset (its dimensions, the variables inside, types of data, etc.)

### Task 3
Imagine that you are preparing a brief for the local health authority, and they have asked you to answer the following questions. For each question, write a chunk of code that would provide the answer in a clean and reproducible way.

### Task 3.1
Which injury mechanism caused the most deaths in total?

```{r most-deaths}
tbi_age %>% 
  filter(type == "Deaths" & age_group == "Total") %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_est)) %>% 
  head(n = 1)
```

### Task 3.2
Looking just at the totals, what is the number of ED visits, hospitalisations and deaths
associated with each injury mechanism? Present the results as a table. Save this table in your tables folder.

```{r totals-table}
totals_table <- tbi_age %>%
  filter(age_group == "Total") %>% 
  select(-rate_est) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type", values_from = "number_est") %>% 
  select(-age_group) %>% 
  arrange(injury_mechanism)

write_csv(totals_table, file = here("tables", "totals_table.csv"))
  
```
### Task 3.3
Focusing on the oldest age group (75+), draw a bar chart illustrating the number of hospitalisations associated with each injury mechanism. Make sure that you add a title and appropriate axis labels. Save this chart in your plots folder.

```{r oldest-hospitalisations}
tbi_age$injury_mechanism <- str_wrap(tbi_age$injury_mechanism, width = 15)

oldest_hosp_plot <- tbi_age %>% 
  filter(age_group == "75+" & type == "Hospitalizations") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = injury_mechanism, y = number_est)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))

# example_plot <- tbi_age %>% 
#   filter(age_group == "75+" & type == "Hospitalizations") %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x = injury_mechanism)) +
#   geom_bar()
# 
# example_plot

oldest_hosp_plot
```
